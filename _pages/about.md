I'm Aparajito, a first year master's student in robotics at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. My research interests comprise multi-agent planning, visual-language models, and human-robot interaction. Specifically, my objective is to develop full-stack software solutions to enable context-aware planning and control for multi-robot systems to assist humans in dynamic, unpredictable environments. 

Prior to my graduate studies at Michigan Robotics, I was a Software Development Engineer at [Amazon Fulfillment Technologies and Robotics](https://amazon.jobs/en/teams/amazon-robotics) based in North Reading, Massachusetts. I was part of the team responsible for driving task allocation, distributed control and multi-agent path finding for the 750,000+ mobile robots in Amazon's warehouse network. I have been directly involved in designing large-scale software solutions for some of Amazon's latest robotic solutions, such as [Sequoia](https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/operations/amazon-introduces-new-robotics-solutions) and [Proteus](https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/operations/amazon-robotics-autonomous-robot-proteus-warehouse-packages). 

I earned my Bachelor of Science from Cornell University in 2022, double majoring with honors in Electrical and Computer Engineering and Computer Science. I was a research assistant the [EmPRISE Lab](https://emprise.cs.cornell.edu/) advised by Professor [Tapomayukh Bhattacharjee](https://sites.google.com/site/tapomayukh), where I worked on whole-arm tactile sensing for robotic manipulators. In addition, I conducted research with the [McMahon Lab](https://mcmahon.aep.cornell.edu/) on neural network architecture search for physics-inspired neural networks. I was also a teaching assistant for a graduate level course in embedded operating systems taught by Professor [Joseph Skovira](https://skovira.ece.cornell.edu/ece5725/) and a team leader for the [Cornell Cup Robotics](https://cornellcuprobotics.com/) project team.

In my spare time, I like to play the guitar, ski, and read! If you have any further questions about my experiences or want to talk about multi-robot planning, decentralized robot control algorithms, or Pink Floyd, feel free to send me an [email](mailto:aparajito.saha@gmail.com).
